Between February and May 2024, there were a series of trainings delivered as part of the Open Mapping Guru Network through the Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific.

I was very happy to deliver this talk with Ramya Ragupathy on tools that can be used for remote desktop mapping. I spoke specifically about the MapSwipe mobile app, which was in process additionally becoming a web app at the time.
