I co-gave this hour long talk / workshop with [Benjamin (Benni) Herfort](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/herfort.html) of the [Heidelberg Institute of GeoInformation Technology (HeiGIT)](https://heigit.org/de/) at [State of the Map Europe 2023](https://2023.stateofthemap.eu/) in Antwerp, Belgium.

We worked together to create a [new dashboard](https://stats.now.ohsome.org/dashboard) to capture OpenStreetMap stats for everyone using hashtags when mapping using the [HOT Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/). This talk demonstrated the new tool, our process, and findings. 

We also had folks test out the tool, and ran a workshop about various use cases it could be used for with those present. 

Lots of interesting discussions were had! ðŸ˜Š

## [Talk synopsis](https://2023.stateofthemap.eu/program/introducing-the-ohsomenow-stats-dashboard-a-workshop-for-measuring-your-impact)

The ohsomeNow stats dashboard and API provide up-to-date and global scale overview statistics on mapping activity in OpenStreetMap. Join us in a workshop where you'll learn what the new dashboard is, a bit about its background, and how to use it to measure your impact across OSM.
