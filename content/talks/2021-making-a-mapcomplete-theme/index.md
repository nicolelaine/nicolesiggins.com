[MapComplete](https://mapcomplete.org/) is a thematic OpenStreetMap viewer and question-based editor with the aim of being really easy to use. It's aim to get folks contributing their local knowledge to OpenStreetMap, without necessarily needing to understand the OSM tagging system. It is meant to be for easy entry and getting people excited about mapping!

I was approached by the developer of [Postcrossing](https://www.postcrossing.com/) (a truly fabulous postcard sharing and sending website that you should definitely check out!) about creating a tool that would allow would-be postcard senders to find the closest and most accessible postbox or post office in their vicinity to be able to send their cards - especially when in an unfamiliar environment, like on holiday. 

I dove into the project and in the process found MapComplete. A true gem of a tool with an amazing helpful community for folks who want to make a custom theme. Everyone was so helpful as I worked my way through the ins and outs of making the theme and getting it accepted as an official theme on the MapComplete website.

I gave a short presentation on my experience making this theme at London Missing Maps on November 2, 2021.

You can find the theme [here](https://mapcomplete.org/postboxes.html?).
