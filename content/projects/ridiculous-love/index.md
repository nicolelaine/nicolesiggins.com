Love is often ridiculous. This participatory art project invites you to share your experiences of how ridiculous love is for you. 

Ridiculous Love is designed to be a temporary project. Beer crates make up it's base, which are easily returnable after breakdown, and the pink cloth is a stretchy latex, which folds down nicely into a small pile. 

The music is a mix of The Wig by Lalo Schifrin, and my partner and I leaving long distance voice mails on the voice app Voxer over a period of 18 months. 

The first installation of Ridiculous Love happened on September 30th, 2017 in Volkspark Friedrichshain, Berlin, Germany.
