Love is often ridiculous. This participatory art project invites you to share your experiences of how ridiculous love is for you. 

Ridiculous Love is designed to be a temporary project. Beer crates make up it's base, which are easily returnable after breakdown, and the pink cloth is a stretchy latex, which folds down nicely into a small pile. 

The project comes with 4 sets of headphones, so you can listen to the installation with your many loved ones, all that the same time. 

The audio is a mix of The Wig by Lalo Schifrin, and my partner and I leaving long distance voice mails on the voice app Voxer over a period of 18 months. This is what is heard through the headphones, on a loop. 

Participants are then asked to write down how love is ridiculous for them, and pin it to the side of installation.

The first installation of Ridiculous Love happened on September 30th, 2017 in Volkspark Friedrichshain, Berlin, Germany.

Time lapse was taken by [OSnap!](https://www.osnapphotoapp.com/) and edited to include the installation's audio piece.
