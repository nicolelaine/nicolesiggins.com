I made my first video game as part of the 2019 Pixelles Game Incubator VII Follow Along program. 

The game is programed in [Stencyl](https://www.stencyl.com/) and the dog and trees were created in [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/). The sniffs were created with the spray paint function in [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/). The snorts and crunches were of a random dog on the internet on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).

The music is "Happy Sandbox" by Motivve (now known as "Unlistenable.")

The game is [uploaded on itch.io](https://nesnes.itch.io/sniffy-dog) and is only available to play on a computer.

Have fun playing! ü¶¥
