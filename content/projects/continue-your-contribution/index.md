While working at the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) I organized and led hundreds of events for corporate employees, introducing them to[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and how to map for humanitarian purposes using the [HOT Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/) and [MapSwipe4Web](https://web.mapswipe.org).

A continuous challenge was that many of these volunteers were interested in continuing their open geo data journey, however, lacked the resources to stay connected to the wider mapping community.

I created two simple webpages that could be linked to a QR code so excited volunteers could keep mapping long after the event was over. 

You can find the "Continue your Contribution" page [here](https://hotosm.netlify.app/).

And a MapSwipe specific page [here](https://mapswipe.netlify.app/). ðŸš€
