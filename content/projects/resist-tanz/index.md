A short film by Nicole Siggins and Adina Bogert-Oâ€™Brien, March 2017

*In an ever tumultuous world, these resistors dance their erratic, playful and furious dance. They are at war, they are fighting, they long to be free. They escape their confines, resist, and are dragged back into slavery. They move, they combat, they dance. They are spiky and strong. They are up against each other. Their conflict becomes a dance. Today is the time to resist, take action, and use the magnetic forces that exist to let yourself dance free in resistance. Resist Tanz.*

- Selected for the [33rd Hamburg International Short Film Festival](https://festival.shortfilm.com) (June 2017)
- Selected for the [31st Braunschweig International Short Film Festival](https://www.filmfest-braunschweig.de/) (October 2017)

Resist Tanz was created in about three weeks during March 2017. My partner Adina, came up with the concept. We cut arm holes in a paper box, lined it with white paper, and cut a hole in the top for the camera. I shot the film using an iOS app called [OSnap!](https://www.osnapphotoapp.com/) and edited the film in Final Cut Pro. The sound is a mixture of my layered and filtered voice mixed with parts of a [song](https://archive.org/details/TapePlayCollection/04-SlowMove.mp3) called "Slow Move" by Greenhouse George.

Resist Tanz was created specifically as a submission to the 33rd Hamburg International Short Film Festival, under the Triple Axel Competition round, which are films under three minutes relating to a chosen theme. 2017's theme was "Resistance." 

The title is a play on both German and English words and was a ton of fun to make!
