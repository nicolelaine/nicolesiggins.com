Between 2023 and 2024, I was part of the [Women+ in Geospatial mentorship program](https://womeningeospatial.org/mentorship-programme/) - cohort 5.

The program offers one-on-one mentorâ€“mentee relationships, mentorâ€“mentee groups, or peer-to-peer mentorship groups. Our group of four was part of the peer-to-peer mentorship model. We met up regularly and discussed topics about being female in the workplace, especially when working in the geospatial landscape. We also gave each other presentations about what we did on a day to day basis in our jobs - something I suggest everyone do with their friends and communities - it's fascinating!

As part of the program, each group within the cohort creates a legacy project - something to symbolize the time spent together. We decided to create a one episode podcast and host it on a landing page. Our podcast, titled "WiG Radio" is about being a woman in GIS, winding career paths, what our loved ones think we do, and more. I created a specialized landing page to hold our episode.

Listen to [our episode](https://nicolelaine.github.io/wig-radio/)!

You can find the rest of the legacy projects from our cohort, and other cohorts over the years in the [legacy gallery](https://womeningeospatial.org/legacy-gallery/).

Enjoy! ðŸŽ§
