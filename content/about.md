## What I Do 🚀

### Web Development
I'm a self taught programmer, and it's my favorite way to relax, have fun, and learn something new. I love playing around with code, hacking things together, and seeing what I can make. I also like exploring the history of programming languages and staying up-to-date with new tech developments. My favorite languages are JavaScript (especially [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)), and Python for it's plethora of libraries. I built this site in [Hugo](/misc/2025-03-13-making-this-hugo-site/) using [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), which has also introduced me to Go.


### Open Geo Data Collection
I'm heavily involved in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), a free, open, and global community project, sometimes referred to as the "wikipedia of maps." I like mapping buildings, postboxes, benches, swimming pools, and waste bins. I'm a core member of [Missing Maps London](spaces/missing-maps-london/), a lovely group of people who map together regularly for disaster planning and response.


### Teaching & Sharing Knowledge
I enjoy connecting with users of tech tools and helping people find and use available resources to achieve their goals. I like sharing tips that help others navigate the constantly evolving tech world. I'm someone who gets joy out of helping my parents with their tech woes!

I welcome beginners—no question is too silly—and I’m great at translating between users and developers. I love seeing the smile on someone’s face when they realize they better understand a tool and can get the most out of it.

### Project & Product Management 

I love seeing a project through to completion. Most recently, I secured funding and helped launch a web version of the popular [MapSwipe](https://mapswipe.org) humanitarian mapping mobile app. [MapSwipe4Web](https://web.mapswipe.org) was born, with funding from the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/) and developed by the [Heidelberg Institute for GeoInformation Technology (HeiGIT)](https://heigit.org). MapSwipe4Web now also has [street level imagery projects](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/mapswipe-street-level-imagery/), which I also secured funding for and helped manage into production.

I'm on the [MapSwipe governance team](/spaces/mapswipe-governance-team/) and love helping to guide its growth and optimization. I've contributed to shaping its current roadmap, documenting user-reported bugs, and developing training materials and resources.

## My Journey ✨

I've worn many hats throughout my life: filmmaker, preschool teacher, tech support agent, administrator, community organizer, event organizer, b2b relationship manager, project manager, (unofficial) product manager, tech lead. I am endlessly curious, am a life-long learner, and love having a beginner's / growth mindset! Each role I’ve held has deepened my passion for solving complex problems, making things happen, and helping others feeling confident in learning something new.
