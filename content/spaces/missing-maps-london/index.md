## Who are we?

We're a tight-knit nerdy group of both advanced and beginner mappers, who meet regularly to map together for humanitarian purposes, and to teach others how to do the same. Missing Maps London is a welcoming and open community. Newbies are very welcome to stop by our events! Dogs and children are also welcome. ðŸ˜Š

Missing Maps London started as an in-person event, with rotating locations within the London area. Since the pandemic, we are primarily online, and our community is now London in name only. Our members come from all over the world, with most members being based in the UK, Europe, and the USA. Anyone is welcome to stop by, provided that you are still awake when our event is happening!

## When and where do we meet?

We hold (virtual) events for beginners / newbie mappers on the first Tuesday of each month, starting at 19:00 UTC. We'll teach you how to map using the embedded iD OpenStreetMap editor, how to download, install, and use the JOSM editor, or how to be a validator on the HOT Tasking Manager.

Don't know what any of these terms mean? Still interested anyways? You should definitely stop by!

You can get a (free) ticket [here](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/missingmapslondon/1040085).

Really looking forward to seeing you there!
