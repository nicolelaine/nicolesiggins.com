## What is MapSwipe?

[MapSwipe](https://mapswipe.org) is a mobile phone and [web app](https://web.mapswipe.org), that harnesses the collective strength of volunteers to actively contribute to geospatial data projects.

## What does the MapSwipe Governance Team Do?

The MapSwipe Governance Team is a group of elected individuals that help guide the development of the MapSwipe tool. We make core decisions on what will be prioritized, document community decisions, and help monitor the email inbox. We have an election cycle and monthly meetings.

I was very excited to be elected in November 2024 for the current rendition of the MapSwipe Governance Team. I love the MapSwipe tool and am happy to help ensure it's continued success. If you have any questions on MapSwipe, please reach out - I'm very happy to help. ðŸ˜Š
