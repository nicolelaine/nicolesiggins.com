I've been a voting member of the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/) since 2022.

A voting member is a part of HOT's core team, who have shown commitment to the [HOT mission](https://www.hotosm.org/hots-vision-and-values.html), upholding the [HOT Code of conduct](https://www.hotosm.org/code-of-conduct.html). Voting Members are responsible for voting “on matters affecting the Corporation including, but not limited to, the election of directors and [additional] voting members” and helping in a variety of tasks like remote mapping initiatives and also things like technical development work and community building in the field.

You can see a list of all current HOT voting members [here](https://www.hotosm.org/voting-members.html).
