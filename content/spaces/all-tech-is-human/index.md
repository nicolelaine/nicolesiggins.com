I'm still quite new to the All Tech is Human community, but am thoroughly enjoying being around a group of people who are interested in responsible tech and the future. And they have lots of interesting webinars!

Check them out [here](https://alltechishuman.org/).

They also have a [Responsible Tech Guide](https://alltechishuman.org/responsible-tech-guide) and a [2025 Community Report](https://alltechishuman.org/responsible-tech-community-report).

I can't wait to learn more and meet many individuals as part of this community!
