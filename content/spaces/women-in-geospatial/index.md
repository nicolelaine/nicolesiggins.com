[Women+ in Geospatial](https://womeningeospatial.org) is a global professional network to promote diversity and gender-equality in the geospatial industry and academia.

It's a great network of over 5000 individuals, hosts a mentorship program, webinars, has an active Slack workspace, and a speaker database.

I took part in Cohort 5 of the mentorship program and got to bond with a lovely group of people! Together we made a legacy project, which you can read more about [here](/projects/wig-radio/).
