I built this site in Hugo and this post is to keep track of what I did, so a.) I can remember what I did and b.) so someone else can follow along in case they like my site and want to recreate it.\nWhy Hugo? #I built my first website an a now discontinued product called iWeb, which came built in on a Mac computer. It was perfect for what it was at the time, drag and drop boxes, built in themes, etc. I was dismayed when it was discontinued and moved to Wordpress.org.\nWordPress was interesting to learn, and I somewhat enjoyed it. After they moved to \u0026ldquo;blocks\u0026rdquo;, a bit less so. üòä I found that I was always searching for themes that I didn\u0026rsquo;t really love, and it felt large and bloated, and was really a bit too much for what I was needed. Life got busy and the thought of moving off of Wordpress felt overwhelming and there was always something more important to do.\nAs I became a daily programmer, and as part of my work in open data, open source, and the Missing Maps ecosystem, I discovered static site generators. My first go was with Jekyll, where I built a prototype of a new website for Missing Maps, using the Dogwood theme.\nWhen it came time to move off Wordpress and also to bring my website into the present day, I had been hearing a lot about Hugo, and it\u0026rsquo;s revolutionary build times and modern feel. I thought it would be fun to learn and experiment with. And it has been! While there has been some initial struggles here and there with learning Hugo\u0026rsquo;s quirks, I find it fun to work on my website while using Hugo, and I am very excited I found it!\nGetting Started #If you are new to Hugo, I would highly recommend this Giraffe Academy YouTube course and follow along. It was very helpful in getting used to the specific Hugo terminology and how the overrides and directory structures work.\nRules of the Game #If you are just getting started in Hugo, and you are using a predefined theme, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that there are general rules that Hugo follows, and there are also rules that the theme you chose follows. These may or may not be the same! This can be incredibly confusing at the start and each set of docs seems to contradict each other and can keep you up all night.\nImportant! Do not panic! Sleep on it for a night. Go to a yoga class. Have a friend look it over with you. It DOES get easier!! The Congo Hugo Theme #I chose the Congo theme because it had the simplicity I wanted, seemed to be updated regularly, and had good documentation. It\u0026rsquo;s made by a person named James Panther, who is also a lighting designer, digital privacy advocate, and food lover.\nInstallation #I was still relatively new to Hugo when I started making this website. I decided to install the Congo theme as a Hugo module, since that was what was recommended. The Hugo module seems to make it the easiest to keep the theme up to date in the future, but it does makes things a bit abstract in the present, since you can\u0026rsquo;t actually \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the theme in your directory. Which means if you want to override anything, you need to be a bit patient in figuring it out.\nWhen installing a theme using Hugo modules, you should NEVER mess with the theme files. This will make it difficult to update later. You should using a system of overwriting to get what you want in your own layout directory. I found this page helpful.\nWhen installing as a Hugo module, you essentially copy the files over from your computer\u0026rsquo;s cache into a config folder, and your theme folder will remain empty. You also end up with some Go files in your directory.\nBecause, when you install as a Hugo module, you can\u0026rsquo;t actually \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the theme in your project, I suggest looking at the layout files on the Congo Github to understand how they are programmed. This will especially come in handy if you want to override something in the theme to make the site more your own.\nCreating Files Across the Site #Structure is everything in Hugo. In order to make the nav bar items, I created a folder for each nave item (except the about page - that\u0026rsquo;s at the root.) Each folder should then have an _index.md in them to create that topic\u0026rsquo;s landing page. You can add some text on this page to give a summary of what that landing page will contain. Then, each item on the landing page has it\u0026rsquo;s own folder with it\u0026rsquo;s own index.md inside (note the lack of the _ !) which makes it a single format instead of a list format. This is what makes the page feel like a page and less of an \u0026ldquo;index\u0026rdquo; of other pages. Hurrah!\nAny images you want to go with your pages will be inside of that folder with the index.md. If you want it to be a cover image, you can put the word \u0026ldquo;feature\u0026rdquo; somewhere in the title of that image and Congo will pull it in directly. If you have a lot of images, you might consider putting them in another folder called images and you can keep things organized and link from there. Make sure your paths are correct! If you have any global images, you can also put them in the static folder (like a logo that goes across your site, etc.), however, you then lose the responsiveness factor that comes with Hugo bundles.\nThe setup of Hugo does make it feel like you have 15 index.md ages and 15 _index.md pages, all nested in various folders, which to me felt dizzying at the start, but one does start to get used to it..\nYour home page is always the main _index.md file in your directory. I added the \u0026ldquo;Learn More\u0026rdquo; at the bottom of my home page by adding the a button and function to that file.\nGetting 0001 Off the List Pages #In the Congo theme, by default the single pages are grouped by year on the index pages. If you don\u0026rsquo;t set a year, this will automatically be set to the year of 0001, which means that this will end up as the first entry on any of your single pages listed on the index page. To get rid of this, you can set groupByYear = false in the params.toml file in the [list] section.\nSmall Thumbnails Featured on the List Pages #If you want each of your _index pages to have a list of icons next to the directories listed on that page, you need to put an image file in the root of each directory, and it needs to have \u0026ldquo;feature\u0026rdquo; written somewhere in the image name.\nThe Cascade #If you want the same features to be true on each of your pages in any given section (i.e. you want each article to show up under \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; or you don\u0026rsquo;t want to show the author on each page), you can create a cascade on the _index.md file for that section. This makes it so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to repeat yourself then putting each of these in the front matter of each page.\nHere is the cascade for the _index.md file for my Projects section.\ntitle: \u0026#34;Projects\u0026#34; cascade: categories: [\u0026#34;Projects\u0026#34;] showAuthor: false showPagination: false Important! If you want to use the cascade, the _index pages for the sections will also inherit the category. This means that the list pages will also show up on your categories page, which might look odd. If you want to avoid this, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add an empty array to the category in the front matter of these list pages.\nLike so:\ncategories: [] cascade: categories: [\u0026#34;Projects\u0026#34;] This makes the actual _index file NOT inherit the category, but all the child pages will.\nDo note that it\u0026rsquo;s best to use the cascade for any parts of the theme you want to overwrite - for example, if there is one section that you want to have certain features on. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to set something the same across the entire site, it\u0026rsquo;s more efficient to set these in the params.toml config file.\nTo Get Rid of the Dates on Only Some _index Pages #You need to override the theme by adding a layouts/partials/article-meta.html file and make sure you add the list page page on which you want to get rid of the dates. In my case, it was the \u0026ldquo;spaces\u0026rdquo; list page that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to include the dates on.\nSo this:\n{{ if .Params.showDate | default (.Site.Params.article.showDate | default true) }} {{ $meta.Add \u0026#34;partials\u0026#34; (slice (partial \u0026#34;meta/date.html\u0026#34; .Date)) }} {{ end }} Changes to this:\n{{ if not (or (hasPrefix .File.Dir \u0026#34;spaces/\u0026#34;) (eq .File.BaseFileName \u0026#34;_index.md\u0026#34;)) }} {{ if .Params.showDate | default (.Site.Params.article.showDate | default true) }} {{ $meta.Add \u0026#34;partials\u0026#34; (slice (partial \u0026#34;meta/date.html\u0026#34; .Date)) }} {{ end }} {{ end }} Switching Out the Light Mode Icon from the Sun to the Light Bulb #A friend commented that the sun icon to change from dark to light mode looked like a gear icon instead of a sun. I didn\u0026rsquo;t disagree. She suggested I swap it out for a lightbulb icon instead.\nHere is how I did it:\nI saw that there was a lightbulb icon in the assets directory of Congo in Github. I downloaded that and added it to my own assets/icons directory.\nI then did a search of the Congo Github repo for any mentions of \u0026ldquo;sun.\u0026rdquo;\nThat included the following pages:\nThe hybrid header (what I chose for my instance) The basic header The footer.html In these files, I swapped out any mention of \u0026ldquo;sun\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;lightbulb.\u0026rdquo; The basic file had one and the hybrid and footer files had two.\nPutting the Appearance Switcher in the Header #If you want your appearance switcher in the header, as opposed to the footer, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to do the following:\n1.) Set the showAppearanceSwitcher in the params.toml to false 2.) Add this to your menus.en.toml\n- identifier: \u0026#34;appearance\u0026#34; weight: 99 params: action: \u0026#34;appearance\u0026#34; Deployment to Github Pages with a Custom URL #First, in the config file, make sure you set the baseURL to your custom domain, making sure to include the / at the end.\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;https://www.nicolesiggins.com/\u0026#34; You\u0026rsquo;ll also want to add a CNAME file to your static folder.\necho \u0026#34;www.nicolesiggins.com\u0026#34; \u0026gt; static/CNAME When you want to develop locally and change your site, you can run the following:\nhugo server --baseURL http://localhost:1313/ Or, you can create a script that you can run at the root directory. I made a file called serve.sh at the root of my project. Inside I put the following:\n#!/bin/bash hugo server --baseURL http://localhost:1313/ --disableFastRender Then, when I want to develop locally, I run the following to view it on the local host:\n./serve.sh You\u0026rsquo;ll also want to create a .gitignore file at the root of your project. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how to get started, this website can help. You can add your operating system, any frameworks you are using, as well as your IDE.\nTo deploy on Github, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create a deploy.yml file inside of .github/workflows, which should sit in the root of your project.\nHere is the workflow I decided upon:\nname: Deploy Hugo site to GitHub Pages on: push: branches: - main jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout source uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.123.8\u0026#39; extended: true - name: Cache Hugo modules uses: actions/cache@v3 with: path: ~/.cache/hugo key: ${{ runner.os }}-hugo-${{ hashFiles(\u0026#39;**/go.sum\u0026#39;) }} restore-keys: | ${{ runner.os }}-hugo- - name: Install dependencies (for Hugo Modules) run: hugo mod tidy - name: Build the site run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public It\u0026rsquo;s important that once you push your site to Github, that you ensure that your permissions for the repo are correct, otherwise the Github actions won\u0026rsquo;t be able to resolve.\nFor the repo you want to deploy, go to Settings \u0026gt; Actions \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Workflow permissions, and make sure that the \u0026ldquo;Read and write permissions\u0026rdquo; button is selected. And remember to save!\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll then need to make a small change to your site, and push again to Github, so that workflow can run, and create the gh-pages branch for you.\nOnce this happens, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to get Github Pages set up.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Pages \u0026gt; Build and Development and choose \u0026ldquo;Deploy from a branch.\u0026rdquo; Choose gh-pages and leave it set as /root.\nFurther down the page you can add your custom domain. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to make sure your DNS records / name servers are correct for Github at your domain registrar. My registrar is Porkbun, who had a nifty little button for Github, that got this set up for me.\nI hope this helps!\nGot any feedback? #Please get in touch!

I was already deeply involved in the world in the world of OpenStreetMap and humanitarian mapping, and was ready to take the next steps to learn more about validating open map data and other humanitarian tech tools. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get into the program, however, a few months later the team put out a YouTube playlist, which was very exciting. I thought it would be fun and informative to undertake a \u0026ldquo;self study\u0026rdquo;, where I went through the content on my own, taking notes on what I learned. You can find my notes here.\nWhat is the HOT Data Quality Internship? #Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team‚Äôs (HOT) Data Quality Internship was a twelve week training and professional development program, allowing 25 participants to become deeply involved within the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and community, while gaining transferable geospatial skills. The program ran on an annual basis between 2020 and 2022.\nWhat I learned during my self study #As I had been in the OpenStreetMap world for several years before this self study, the material was not completely foreign to me.\nI was already well versed in mapping using the HOT Tasking Manager and the JOSM mapping editor.\nMy favorite discoveries during the self study were KeepRight, OSMose, OSM Inspector, and Disaster Ninja, all tools that can help mappers improve on existing OSM data and inform on which areas of the world might have data gaps.\nIf you are interested in learning about ways that you can contribute to OpenStreetMap via a wide variety of tools, I would highly suggest this self study! And if you have any questions, please reach out. I love talking about mapping and all things OpenStreetMap and humanitarian tools. üòä\n","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/2021-hot-data-quality-internship/","section":"Projects","summary":"I applied for the 2021 HOT Data Quality Internship.","title":"2021 HOT Data Quality Internship Program - a self study"},{"content":"MapComplete is a thematic OpenStreetMap viewer and question-based editor with the aim of being really easy to use. It\u0026rsquo;s aim to get folks contributing their local knowledge to OpenStreetMap, without necessarily needing to understand the OSM tagging system. It is meant to be for easy entry and getting people excited about mapping!\nI was approached by the developer of Postcrossing (a truly fabulous postcard sharing and sending website that you should definitely check out!) about creating a tool that would allow would-be postcard senders to find the closest and most accessible postbox or post office in their vicinity to be able to send their cards - especially when in an unfamiliar environment, like on holiday.\nI dove into the project and in the process found MapComplete. A true gem of a tool with an amazing helpful community for folks who want to make a custom theme.

They are at war, they are fighting, they long to be free. They escape their confines, resist, and are dragged back into slavery. They move, they combat, they dance. They are spiky and strong. They are up against each other. Their conflict becomes a dance. Today is the time to resist, take action, and use the magnetic forces that exist to let yourself dance free in resistance. Resist Tanz.\nSelected for the 33rd Hamburg International Short Film Festival (June 2017) Selected for the 31st Braunschweig International Short Film Festival (October 2017) Resist Tanz was created in about three weeks during March 2017. My partner Adina, came up with the concept. We cut arm holes in a paper box, lined it with white paper, and cut a hole in the top for the camera. I shot the film using an iOS app called OSnap! and edited the film in Final Cut Pro. The sound is a mixture of my layered and filtered voice mixed with parts of a song called \u0026ldquo;Slow Move\u0026rdquo; by Greenhouse George.\nResist Tanz was created specifically as a submission to the 33rd Hamburg International Short Film Festival, under the Triple Axel Competition round, which are films under three minutes relating to a chosen theme. 2017\u0026rsquo;s theme was \u0026ldquo;Resistance.\u0026rdquo;\nThe title is a play on both German and English words and was a ton of fun to make!\nConcept: Adina Bogert-O\u0026rsquo;Brien\nCamera, Editing, Sound: Nicole Siggins\n","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/resist-tanz/","section":"Projects","summary":"A short film by Nicole Siggins and Adina Bogert-O‚ÄôBrien, March 2017","title":"Resist Tanz - a short film about being stuck in a bag"},{"content":"‚ú® Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Nicole. ‚ú® #I\u0026rsquo;m a map nerd, dog lover, and open data / tech enthusiast.\nWhat I Do üöÄ #Web Development #I\u0026rsquo;m a self taught programmer, and it\u0026rsquo;s my favorite way to relax, have fun, and learn something new. I love playing around with code, hacking things together, and seeing what I can make. I also like exploring the history of programming languages and staying up-to-date with new tech developments. My favorite languages are JavaScript (especially p5.js), and Python for it\u0026rsquo;s plethora of libraries. I built this site in Hugo using Congo, which has also introduced me to Go.\nOpen Geo Data Collection #I\u0026rsquo;m heavily involved in OpenStreetMap, a free, open, and global community project, sometimes referred to as the \u0026ldquo;wikipedia of maps.\u0026rdquo; I like mapping buildings, postboxes, benches, swimming pools, and waste bins. I\u0026rsquo;m a core member of Missing Maps London, a lovely group of people who map together regularly for disaster planning and response.\nTeaching \u0026amp; Sharing Knowledge #I enjoy connecting with users of tech tools and helping people find and use available resources to achieve their goals. I like sharing tips that help others navigate the constantly evolving tech world.

I love seeing the smile on someone‚Äôs face when they realize they better understand a tool and can get the most out of it.\nProject \u0026amp; Product Management #I love seeing a project through to completion. Most recently, I secured funding and helped launch a web version of the popular MapSwipe humanitarian mapping mobile app. MapSwipe4Web was born, with funding from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and developed by the Heidelberg Institute for GeoInformation Technology (HeiGIT). MapSwipe4Web now also has street level imagery projects, which I also secured funding for and helped manage into production.\nI\u0026rsquo;m on the MapSwipe governance team and love helping to guide its growth and optimization. I\u0026rsquo;ve contributed to shaping its current roadmap, documenting user-reported bugs, and developing training materials and resources.\nMy Journey ‚ú® #I\u0026rsquo;ve worn many hats throughout my life: filmmaker, preschool teacher, tech support agent, administrator, community organizer, event organizer, b2b relationship manager, project manager, (unofficial) product manager, tech lead.
